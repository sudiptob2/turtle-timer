# Turtle Race CountDown Timer

Boost your productivity with **pomodoro technique** and **Turtle race countdown timer.** Built with react.js

## Description

Turtle race countdown timer is a simple countdown timer. But the interesting thing is that in any traditional countdown timer you do not get any reward when the timer finishes. But in the Turtle race countdown timer you can choose your **ALPHA** turtle in your mind before starting the timer. After the race finishes you can see how your turtle did and check your luck. It kept me using the **pomodoro technique** more and more as well as the **timer.** It's really fun because **SLOWER THE TURTLE, BETTER THE TURTLE**

As the velocity constantly changing, you never know who wins!
